Iam frightened and Terrified by the life choices that I made, 
Now Iam overwhelmed by the thought of changing things so late, 
Iam worried if Iam too Late.
Still Foolishly trying to be optimistic of my future.
Thinking about changing my career path towards a different CS line maybe data analysis, cloud computing etc.,
I don't know.
