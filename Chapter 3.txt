I don't know if my GOD loves me or Waiting to punish me for my mistakes, 
my laziness and my lack of focus or maybe its none of it and I'm just gonna be punishing myself.
The fear of not summing up to anything respectable is eating me alive everyday, specially before i go to sleep
after wasting the entire day playing video games or surfing through facebook or reddit.
