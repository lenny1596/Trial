I just wish i had enough time & wisdom at that moment, what could have been if i hadn't been so foolish.
By the way, Love my brand new Xbox Series X, already had played couple of games. Iam really into RPG and racing games.
Starting to like Forza Horizon 4 again, before it had become kinda tedious & irritating.
